This repository showcases a common, yet subtle bug in PHP array manipulation. The `incrementValue` function attempts to increment the value at a given index in an array.  However, it only handles out-of-bounds indexes by silently returning. A robust solution should provide explicit feedback or throw an exception to alert the developer to the error. The `bugSolution.php` file presents an improved, safer alternative.
